### Problems to solve
- only take the parrot part after reading /proc/uname
- Convert uptime to hours after reading /proc/uptime(1st part is the true uptime)
- Move the printed text from stdout to the right side of the logo
- Ascii art should be a bit intelligent
- Remove the voidvoidvoid print from stdout

### Progress so far
- Successfully read kernel, uptime and architecture
