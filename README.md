## about
Zfetch is a neofetch-like app that gets systeminfo while printing a cool ascii
besides it. It's zig, so it's blazingly fast (not that anyone cares for something like this :happy:).

## installation
This is not in any repo, so to install

- Git clone the repo
- cd into the repo
- run `zig build`

You can also download pre-built binaries from the releases page
